    There are many deep wounds that we survive if only we could find a way to extricate ourselves from the source of pain. The blades pierce the heart at many angles — the pain throbs in the body, in the emotions, in the memory. It's memory that takes the longest to heal. Long after the body has mended, the scar of betrayal will linger. Constant attention to our pain keeps us from healing.
